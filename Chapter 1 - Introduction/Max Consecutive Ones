Max Consecutive Ones
Question
Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

Example 1:
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.

Note:
The input array will only contain 0 and 1.
The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000

Pseudo Code:
Declare the Variables oneCounter and tempCounter
Initialize them to zero
Run the Outer For loop
If one is encountered
Increment oneCounter by one
If tempCounter is less than oneCounter
tempCounter <- oneCounter

Else(zero is encountered)
Set oneCounter to zero

Return tempCounter

    int oneCounter = 0, tempCounter = 0;
    
    for(int i = 0; i < numsSize ; i++) {
        
        if(nums[i] == 1) {
            oneCounter++;
            
            if(tempCounter < oneCounter) {
                tempCounter = oneCounter;
            }
        }
        
        else {
            oneCounter = 0;
        }
    }
    return tempCounter;
